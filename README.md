**My Process**

This was my first time doing a project with Javascript. After I coded the HTML and CSS, I then proceeded to write the Javascript code. I have already learned most of the necessary characteristics to complete this project. A new CSS property was introduced in this lesson. The text-overflow: ellipsis property and value were new and necessary for one of the elements in the element grid to meet the design.

In order to create the necessary actions for the webpage, I watched a tutorial video through Yandex which was extremely helpful in describing how to code the functions in Javascript. In addition to the videos offered by Yandex, their tutors were also very helpful in making sure that I understood everything and solved any looming issues with my code.

This is only the beginning for my goal of learning Javascript. I will continue to practice and develop my skills in my pursuit of web development.
